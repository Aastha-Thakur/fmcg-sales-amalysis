FMCG Sales Analysis using Python | Data Cleaning, Price Imputation, Clustering &amp; Regression â€“ FieldAssistÂ Dataset
This project involves a detailed analysis of sales data on an FMCG dataset provided by FieldAssist. The dataset had significant inconsistencies and missing values in columns such as MRP, Selling Price, and Units Sold. Using Python in Google Colab, the project focuses on:

-  Data cleaning & transformation
-  Unit standardization (e.g., converting pcs/box)
-  Handling anomalies and missing MRP values
-  Imputing prices using KMeans Clustering + Linear Regression
-  Exploratory Data Analysis on product regions, categories, and performance

The goal was to reconstruct a reliable, insight-ready dataset and extract meaningful trends for better decision-making.
